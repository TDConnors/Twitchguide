The Twitch Channel Guide is a web app that helps Twitch users better navigate Twitch. Twitch is a broadcasting service specifically targeted at video game players. Users can stream their game play from a personal computer, video game console or handheld device. Users will be able to log in to the TCG with their Twitch account. On their TCG account users can set their own streaming schedule. A user will be able to see when a streamer is going to stream as long as the user has followed the streamer. Users will also  be able to change the time scope of their guide. Unlike Twitch's current navigation, the TCG will navigate Twitch using a schedule generated for each user. The Twitch Channel Guides purpose is to simplify and enchance each user's streaming experience.
