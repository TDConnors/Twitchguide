The Twitch Channel Guide is a web app that helps Twitch users better navigate Twitch. Unlike Twitch's current navigation, the TCG will navigate Twitch using a schedule generated for each user. Users wil be able to log in to the TCG with their Twitch account. On their TCG account users can set their own streaming schedule. A user will be able to see when a streamer is going to stream as long as the user has followed the streamer. Users will also  be able to change the time scope of their guide.
